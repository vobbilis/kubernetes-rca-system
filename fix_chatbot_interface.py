Fix for the chatbot interface suggestion rendering.

This file contains the improved code for rendering suggestions in the chatbot interface.
This ensures that suggestions properly correlate with AI responses.
"""

# The issue is likely in how the suggestions are displayed in the UI.
# The solution is to ensure that suggestions are properly rendered after each interaction.

# 1. Original way the suggestions are added:
# suggestions = response.get('suggestions', [])
# add_suggestions(suggestions, investigation_id, db_handler)

# 2. Problem: When a user asks a question, the response includes suggestions in the 'suggestions' field,
#    but the UI might not be properly updated to show these new suggestions.

# 3. Solution: Make sure we're always updating session state with the latest suggestions
#    and triggering a UI refresh after adding them.

# Here's the fix to apply to components/chatbot_interface.py:

"""
